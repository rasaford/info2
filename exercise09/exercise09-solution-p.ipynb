    "1. Side-effects interact with the environment during evaluation. This means writing data without contributing to the returned value or reading data without depending on the arguments. E.g. writing/reading to/from some channel (e.g. stdout, files, network), changing/reading some data outside the function (mutable data structures, e.g. references, hashtables, arrays), reading time, getting random values etc.\n",
    "2. Pure functions are functions without observable side-effects (we ignore the effects of computation itself (e.g. used memory, caches, spent CPU cycles)). Like functions in the mathematical sense, their return value will only depend on the values of the arguments and will therefore always give the same result for some input. Reproducible results facilitate testing, parallization (no interaction between different calls), memoization (we can save the result for some input and don't need to compute it again), and on-demand/lazy evaluation (if there are no side-effects, we only need to evaluate some function if we depend on its value).\n",
    "3. If we have all needed arguments for application and the function has no side-effects, it does not matter when we evaluate it, since the call will always give the same value and not influence anything else. You could argue that even for a pure function it does make a difference when you evaluate if it does not terminate, but this will only make a difference if there are side-effects in the program (i.e. which side-effects are executed before the non-terminating call).\n",
    "4. The only way to convey in the signature (besides some agreed upon convention) that the evaluation is not influenced by an argument, is by limiting its values to exactly one value. If we see a signature `'a -> int` it could for example compute some hash of the first argument (only possible because of the built-in polymorphic functions depending on runtime representation); for `unit -> int` we know that it will either be a constant function or get the `int` via side-effect; for `unit -> unit` we know that the function will only do something via side-effects (or do nothing). The choice of `unit` to indicate side-effects for both arguments and results is rather arbitrary. We could also define something like the following to further classify side-effects:"
